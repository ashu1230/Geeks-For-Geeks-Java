Given root of a n-ary tree find the number of duplicate subtree in the n-ary tree.
Two trees are duplicate if they have the same structure with the same node values.

Example 1:

Input:
1 N 2 2 3 N 4 N 4 4 3 N N N N N

Output: 2
Explanation: [4], [3] are duplicate subtree.
Example 2:

Input:
1 N 2 3 N 4 5 6 N N N N

Output: 0
Explanation: No duplicate subtree found.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function duplicateSubtreeNaryTree() which takes root of n-ary tree as input, and return an integer value as number of duplicate subtrees.
